# constant time complexity or O(1)  complexity.

# Number of operations remain same , no matter how many inputs are provides. exp - picking a random card from deck of 200n cards.

# multiplying a number to itself.

print(multiply(100))

# Here, no matter how long is the input but the multiplication is occuring only 1 time that is n*n
